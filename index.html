    <!--Right now these paragraphs below take up the entirity of the page horizontally. I would like to eventually change the format but am
        unsure if I can through HTML. We will see.-->
    <p> With over a decade of experience playing, recording, mixing and mastering, and video production,
        I have built up a small but dedicated group of fans and listeners who identify with my music, connect with my
        thought processes, and have a similar style of humor. I am so blessed to call many of these people friends.</p>
    <br>
    <p>At the same time, I have begun to dive headfirst into full stack web dev through udemy in hopes of getting an
        intership and
        eventual career within the field. Thank you for visiting this site. If you have any questions or would like to
        contact me please
        reach out through social media @LGMboi or my email LukeGibson099@gmail.com </p>
